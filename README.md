# Ping-Pong Tournament Builder
## The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.

Its up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:
* ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
* continued rounds until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other)
## Tasks Completed

A tool which where the user is able to enter two or more players, randomly creates pairings for a ping-pong tournament bracket from a list of names entered.  

## Project Evaluation

Initially attempted creating a React+redux app. Due to its use of self contained and independent components, which would have allowed for a lot more interactive UIs.

unfortunately struggled greatly with complexicities of react + redux for majority of the project settime.
I therefore turned to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to ensure I met the requirement.
